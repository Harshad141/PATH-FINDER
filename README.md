# PATH-FINDER
Obstacle avoidance is one of the most significant parts of portable mechanical autonomy. Here Obstacle avoidance is by utilizing ultrasonic sensors, It will move a specific way and maintain a strategic distance from the impediment which is coming in its way.

# The problem it solves
It is a model dependent on impediment evasion which utilizes an ultrasonic sensor on its head, It can be utilized in unmanned ground vehicles which are not in charge of people as the vehicle can stay away from any snag in its manner and not giving ay further harm vehicle further mounted on the servo engine the ultrasonic sensor can gauge the separation and show it in the gave LCD show. 
It very well may be utilized in present-day vehicles as a wellbeing measure if an abrupt obstruction is recognized by the ultrasonic sensor the brakes are naturally applied to maintain a strategic distance from any mischief to life and property.
# COMPONENTS USED
## Arduino Uno
The Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328.It has 20 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs and 6 can be used as analog inputs), a 16 MHz resonator, a USB connection, a power jack, an in-circuit system programming ICSP) header and a reset button.

## Ultrasonic Sensor
An ultrasonic sensor is an instrument that measures the distance to an object using ultrasonic sound waves. An ultrasonic sensor uses a transducer to send and receive ultrasonic pulses that relay back information about an object's Proximity.

## LCD & I2C LCD Driver 
-LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) is a type of flat panel display which uses liquid crystals ins primary form of opera LCD. I2C_LCD is an easy-to-use display module, It can make the display easier. Using it can reduce the difficulty of making, So that makers can focus on the core of the work.

## Servo Moter
A servo motor is an electrical device that can push or rotate an object with great precision. If you want to rotate and object at some specific angles or distance, then you use a servo motor.
